# Coursework: Parallel segmentation of point clouds of trees

The project aims to separate the crown and trunk of trees in 3D point clouds using machine learning methods.:
- Random Forest with hyperparameter optimization
- Data processing and scaling, adding additional features
- Parallel execution of calculations to speed up processing
- Comparison with other models to choose the best approach
